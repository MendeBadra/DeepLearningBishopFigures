# DeepLearningBishopFigures

This repository contains my self-driven project to study and reproduce key examples from **Christopher Bishop’s *Deep Learning Foundations and Concepts***. The goal is to deepen understanding of fundamental deep learning concepts by implementing them in Python/Jupyter notebooks and visualizing results.

## Overview

During this project, I focused on reproducing several core examples from Bishop’s book:

* **Curve fitting**: Linear and nonlinear regression examples, exploring model complexity and overfitting.
* **Sinusoidal interpolation**: Reproducing interpolation examples to understand basis functions and function approximation.
* **Density transformations**: Visualizing probability density transformations to gain intuition on probabilistic modeling.

The project emphasizes **reproducibility**, **clarity**, and **visual intuition**, rather than creating production-level code. Each notebook includes explanations, plots, and step-by-step derivations of the underlying mathematics.

## Notebooks

- `Chap2-Transformation-Densities.ipynb` - Transformation of densities have interesting property where they're not quite the same as just regular functions (multiplied by the Jacobian).
